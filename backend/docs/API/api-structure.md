# Itemize.cloud API Structure

## Architecture Overview

The Itemize.cloud API is built on a modern, scalable architecture that is designed to be easy to maintain and extend. It follows a standard RESTful design, with a clear separation of concerns between the different layers of the application.

## Directory Structure

The API is organized into the following directory structure:

```
src/
├── api/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── middleware/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── services/
├── config/
├── lib/
└── utils/
```

## Component Responsibilities

*   **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests, validate input, and call the appropriate services.
*   **Middleware**: Perform cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
*   **Models**: Define the data structures and interact with the database.
*   **Routes**: Map incoming requests to the appropriate controllers.
*   **Services**: Contain the business logic of the application.

## Request Flow

1.  A request is made to the API.
2.  The request is passed through the middleware.
3.  The request is routed to the appropriate controller.
4.  The controller calls the appropriate service.
5.  The service interacts with the models to perform the requested operation.
6.  The service returns a response to the controller.
7.  The controller sends a response to the client.
