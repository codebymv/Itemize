# Itemize.cloud Security Implementation Overview

## Current Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for API access.
- **Google OAuth**: Integration for user login and identity verification.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: (Future consideration) To manage different user permissions.

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: All incoming data is validated to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Used for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
- **Data Encryption (at rest)**: (Future consideration) For sensitive user data.
- **HTTPS/TLS**: All communication between frontend and backend is encrypted using HTTPS.

### API Security
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict CORS policies to allow requests only from authorized origins.
- **Helmet**: Express.js middleware to set various HTTP headers for security.
- **Rate Limiting**: (Future consideration) To protect against brute-force attacks and API abuse.

## Required Pre-Production Security Measures

### 1. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Configure proper SSL/TLS**: Ensure all traffic is encrypted.
- [ ] **Implement proper logging and monitoring**: For security events and anomalies.
- [ ] **Set up automated security scanning**: For vulnerabilities in dependencies and code.

### 2. Authentication Hardening
- [ ] **Implement MFA**: For enhanced user account security.
- [ ] **Set up account lockout policies**: To prevent brute-force attacks.
- [ ] **Configure proper session timeouts**: To minimize the risk of session hijacking.

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] **Encrypt sensitive data at rest**: If any highly sensitive data is stored.
- [ ] **Set up proper backup procedures**: For disaster recovery.
- [ ] **Implement data retention policies**: To comply with privacy regulations.

### 4. Application Security
- [ ] **Complete security code review**: To identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Run vulnerability scanners**: Regularly scan the application for known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Perform penetration testing**: To simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses.
- [ ] **Review third-party dependencies**: Ensure all libraries are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.

## Common Security Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Weak Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Exposing Sensitive Information**: Avoid exposing stack traces, API keys, or other sensitive data in error messages or logs.
- **Insecure Dependencies**: Regularly update and audit third-party libraries.
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Security Monitoring
- **Logging**: Monitor application logs for suspicious activities and errors.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for critical security events.

### 2. Automated Scanning
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**: Regularly scan `package.json` for known vulnerabilities.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. Incident Response
- **Plan**: Develop a clear incident response plan for security breaches.
- **Testing**: Regularly test the incident response plan.
