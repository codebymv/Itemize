# Itemize.cloud Rate Limiting Strategy

## Overview

Currently, Itemize.cloud does not have explicit rate limiting implemented. This document outlines the planned strategy for implementing rate limiting to protect against various types of abuse and ensure fair resource usage.

## Planned Implementation Details

### Tiered Rate Limits (Future)

1.  **Global Rate Limit**
    - **Purpose**: Prevents general abuse and DoS attempts.
    - **Proposed Limit**: e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.

2.  **Authentication Rate Limit**
    - **Purpose**: Prevents brute force attacks on login and registration endpoints.
    - **Proposed Limit**: e.g., 5 attempts per hour per IP.

3.  **API Specific Rate Limits**
    - **Purpose**: Protects specific resource-intensive API endpoints.
    - **Proposed Limit**: Varies per endpoint (e.g., 30 requests per minute for AI suggestions).

### Storage Options

- **Redis Store**: For distributed rate limiting across multiple server instances in production.
- **Memory Store**: For development environments.

## Security Benefits (Future)

- **DDoS Protection**: By limiting the number of requests from a single source.
- **Brute Force Prevention**: Especially for authentication endpoints.
- **API Abuse Prevention**: Ensures fair resource distribution and prevents scraping.

## Error Handling (Future)

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API should return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code with a clear message and relevant headers.

### Proposed Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
}
```

### Proposed HTTP Headers

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time (in UTC epoch seconds) when the current rate limit window resets.
- `Retry-After`: The number of seconds to wait before making another request.

## Monitoring and Maintenance (Future)

- **Logging**: Log rate limit hits and violations for monitoring and analysis.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for unusual spikes in rate limit violations.
- **Adjustment**: Regularly review and adjust rate limits based on usage patterns and security needs.
