# Itemize.cloud Caching Implementation Overview

## Introduction

Currently, Itemize.cloud does not implement a dedicated caching layer beyond standard database query optimizations. This document outlines the potential areas where caching could be introduced to improve application performance and scalability.

## Current State

All data retrieval operations directly query the PostgreSQL database. While PostgreSQL is optimized for performance, repeated requests for the same data can lead to increased database load and slower response times, especially as the user base grows.

## Proposed Caching Strategy (Future)

To enhance performance and reduce database load, a caching layer can be introduced. The primary goal of caching would be to store frequently accessed or computationally expensive data in a fast, temporary storage, thereby reducing the need to hit the database for every request.

### 1. Backend Caching

#### Redis (Recommended)

-   **Purpose**: In-memory data store that can be used for various caching needs.
-   **Use Cases**:
    -   **API Response Caching**: Cache responses for `GET` requests that are frequently accessed and do not change often (e.g., lists, notes, whiteboards for a specific user, if the data is relatively static).
    -   **User Session Caching**: While JWTs are stateless, Redis could be used to store session-related data or blacklisted tokens for immediate invalidation.
    -   **Rate Limiting**: Implement distributed rate limiting across multiple backend instances.

#### Implementation Considerations:
-   Integrate a Redis client library (e.g., `ioredis` or `node-redis`) into the backend.
-   Implement cache-aside pattern: Check cache first, if not found, fetch from DB, then store in cache.
-   Define appropriate Time-To-Live (TTL) for cached data based on its freshness requirements.

### 2. Frontend Caching

#### React Query / TanStack Query

-   **Purpose**: Manages server state in the frontend, including caching, invalidation, and background refetching.
-   **Current Usage**: Itemize.cloud already uses `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching. This library inherently provides a powerful client-side caching mechanism.
-   **Enhancements**: Optimize `staleTime` and `cacheTime` configurations to fine-tune how long data remains fresh and in the cache.

#### Local Storage / Session Storage

-   **Purpose**: Simple client-side persistence for non-sensitive data.
-   **Use Cases**: Could be used for caching UI preferences or less critical, static data to improve perceived performance on subsequent visits.

## Benefits of Implementing Caching

-   **Improved Response Times**: Faster data retrieval for users.
-   **Reduced Database Load**: Less strain on the PostgreSQL database, especially during peak traffic.
-   **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower database resource consumption.
-   **Enhanced Scalability**: Allows the application to handle more concurrent users and requests.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Cache Invalidation Strategies**: Implement robust strategies to ensure cached data is always fresh (e.g., publish/subscribe for real-time invalidation).
-   **Distributed Caching**: For multi-instance deployments, ensure the caching solution works across all instances.
-   **Monitoring**: Implement metrics and dashboards to monitor cache hit rates, miss rates, and overall performance.
