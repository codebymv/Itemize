# Itemize.cloud Security Checklist Before Production

## Current Status: 0% Complete (Placeholder)

This checklist outlines essential security measures to be verified and implemented before deploying Itemize.cloud to a production environment.

### 1. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Configure proper SSL/TLS**: Ensure all traffic is encrypted with valid certificates.
- [ ] **Set up DDoS protection**: Implement measures to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
- [ ] **Implement proper logging and monitoring**: Centralized logging and monitoring for security events.
- [ ] **Set up automated security scanning**: Integrate tools for continuous vulnerability scanning of infrastructure.
- [ ] **Secure database access**: Restrict database access to authorized services and IP addresses only.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For all administrative and sensitive user accounts.
- [ ] **Set up account lockout policies**: To prevent brute-force attacks on user credentials.
- [ ] **Configure proper session timeouts**: Enforce reasonable session durations and automatic logout.
- [ ] **Review JWT secret management**: Ensure JWT secrets are strong, unique, and securely stored.
- [ ] **Implement IP-based restrictions**: For sensitive administrative routes or services.

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] **Encrypt sensitive data at rest**: For any data stored in the database or file system that requires encryption.
- [ ] **Set up proper backup and recovery procedures**: Regularly back up all critical data and test recovery processes.
- [ ] **Implement data retention policies**: Define and enforce policies for how long data is stored.
- [ ] **Configure proper access controls**: Implement granular access controls based on the principle of least privilege.
- [ ] **Set up audit logging**: Log all security-relevant events, including data access and modifications.

### 4. Application Security
- [ ] **Complete security code review**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase for security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Run vulnerability scanners**: Use SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools.
- [ ] **Perform penetration testing**: Engage security professionals to conduct simulated attacks.
- [ ] **Review third-party dependencies**: Regularly audit and update all libraries and frameworks to address known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Implement secure error handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
- [ ] **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.).

### 5. Compliance & Policies
- [ ] **Review privacy policy**: Ensure it accurately reflects data handling practices and complies with regulations.
- [ ] **Implement relevant regulatory requirements**: (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) if applicable.
- [ ] **Set up data breach response procedures**: A clear plan for identifying, containing, and responding to data breaches.
- [ ] **Document security processes**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all security policies and procedures.
- [ ] **Train team on security procedures**: Ensure all team members are aware of and follow security best practices.

## Next Steps

1.  **Prioritize**: Identify the most critical items from this checklist based on risk assessment.
2.  **Assign**: Assign ownership for each item to specific team members.
3.  **Implement**: Begin implementing the necessary security controls.
4.  **Verify**: Thoroughly test all implemented security measures.
5.  **Monitor**: Continuously monitor the application for security threats post-deployment.
